					The proposal submitted to Dept. of Science and Technology for establishment of EDC at SVCE was favorably considered and the NSTEDB ( National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board ) Division, DST, New Delhi recognized our institute for establishment of the same.
					<br><br>
					The Entrepreneurship Development Cell ( EDC-SVCE ) sponsored by the NSTEDB Division of DST GOI, New Delhi was established in the college in December'2002. The DST sanctioned Rs.8.62 Lakhs for the first year of establishment and funding support will be extending for a period of 3 to 5 Years from the date of inception. The ED cell started functioning from February'2003 onwards.
					<br><br>
					Prof.S.Ramesh, Professor in Mechanical Engineering Dept. of this college was appointed as the Chief Project Coordinator. The core staff of EDC - SVCE were recruited as per the guidelines given by DST and all of them joined the cell in mid February'2003. Today the cell is functioning on full time basis to carry out the activities on day-to-day basis. All the infrastructural required for smooth functioning of the cell were created.

					<h4 class="design-inside">Genesis of Entrepreneurship Development Cells </h4>
					<br><br>
					The academic institutions play an important role in the economic development of a country as they produce the right type of manpower needed by different sectors of the society. The technical institutions and institutions of higher learning assume greater importance as these produce the technical manpower needed by the industry and R & D institutions. In order to make optimal use of facilities, expertise and know-how available in these institutions for the benefit of the society, it is necessary that appropriate links are established between the institutes of higher learning and the industry.
					<br><br>
					In order to have better interaction and linkage between Industries and Universities, higher learning institutions, Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India, formed a board, NSTEDB, in the year 1982 which formulated several mechanisms like STEP (Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Park), EDC (Entrepreneurship Development Cells), TBI (Technology Business Incubators) and these mechanisms to be tried out in technical institutions across the country.
					<br><br>
					Today this EDC is one of its kind in Tamilnadu and <em>one among the 20 EDC's existing in the country</em>.
					<br><br>
					<h4 class="design-inside">Objectives</h4>
					<br>
					The main objective of this cell is to <em>train and motivate the Science and Technology (S&T) persons</em> to become <strong><em>Job Creators</em></strong> rather than <strong><em>Job Seekers</em></strong>.
